## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE (v2.x or later)
- CNC Shield V3 (GRBL-compatible)
- [GRBL 1.1 Library](https://github.com/gnea/grbl)

### ⚠️ Safety Precautions
- Eye Protection: Always wear safety goggles. CNC routers produce high-speed wood debris and dust.
- Emergency Stop: Ensure you have a physical "Kill Switch" or a way to disconnect power immediately.
- Dust Management: Wood dust is flammable and hazardous to breathe. Operate in a well-ventilated area or use a vacuum system.
- Mechanical Hazards: Keep hands away from the spindle and lead screws while the machine is powered.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To build your router, follow these guides in the correct order. This ensures you don't damage your electronics before the software is ready.
1.  [**Safety Precautions**](#-safety-precautions) — **Read this first!**
2.  [**Hardware Assembly Guide**](./hardware.md) — How to stack the Arduino/Shield and wire the motors.
3.  [**Software Setup & Configuration**](./software.md) — How to flash GRBL firmware and install control software.
4.  [**Machine Calibration**](#) — *Coming Soon.*

### Steps
1. **Upload GRBL to Arduino**:
   ```bash
   # Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Arduino-CNC-Wood-Router.git
   ```
   - In Arduino IDE: `File > Examples > grbl > grblUpload`.

2. **Upload Custom Code**:
   - Open `src/cnc_controller/cnc_controller.ino`.
   - Install required libraries (if any).
   - Compile and upload to Arduino.

3. **Configure GRBL**:
   - Adjust steps/mm and acceleration in [`config.h`](src/cnc-controller/config.h).
   - Upload settings via `$$` commands in CNC software.

## Hardware Setup

1. **CNC Shield Setup**:
   - Connect steppers to X, Y, Z drivers (A4988/TMC2208).
   - Wire limit switches to X-, Y-, Z- pins.
   - Attach spindle PWM to Pin 11 and enable to Pin 12.

2. **Frame Assembly**:
   - Follow the [Assembly Guide](docs/assembly_guide.md) for mechanical setup.
   - Calibrate steps/mm using [`test_square.gcode`](gcode_examples/test_square.gcode).

---

## Usage
1. **Prepare G-code**:
   - Use [Inkscape with Gcodetools](https://github.com/cnc-club/gcodetools) or [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360).
   - Sample G-code: [`carve_lettering.gcode`](gcode_examples/carve_lettering.gcode).

2. **Run CNC Job**:
   - Open G-code in [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle) or [Universal G-code Sender](https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/).
   - Set zero point (X/Y/Z) on your material.
   - Start job with `Cycle Start`.

3. **Safety Tips**:
   - Always wear safety glasses.
   - Perform dry runs before cutting.
